Build a stack in AWS using NATS and Temporal

This project demonstrates how to integrate [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) for workflow orchestration with [NATS](https://nats.io/) for messaging.

## Overview

Temporal is a powerful workflow orchestration engine that allows you to build and manage complex workflows with ease. NATS is a lightweight, high-performance messaging system that can be used for pub/sub, request/reply, and other messaging patterns.

This example project showcases how to use Temporal to manage workflows and NATS to handle messaging between different components of your application.

## Features

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manage and execute workflows using Temporal.
- **Messaging**: Use NATS for asynchronous communication and event handling.
- **Sample Workflows**: Examples of common workflows integrated with NATS messaging.
